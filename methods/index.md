## What this is
Black Trace publishes open-source case files with AI-assisted triage and human editorial decisions.

## Confidence grades
- **High**: multiple independent corroborations; minimal ambiguity.
- **Medium**: credible indicators; some gaps remain.
- **Low**: early-stage, single-source, or contested.

## Update discipline
- Each case opens with **Today’s Relevance**, followed by dated updates.
- Corrections are logged; prior text is not silently rewritten.

## Sourcing rules
- Prefer primary sources (official docs, direct statements, filings).
- Archive links where possible.
- Distinguish **fact** vs **assessment** vs **hypothesis**.
